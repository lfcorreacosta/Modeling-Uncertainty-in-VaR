# Modeling-Uncertainty-in-VaR

This repository contains the scripts to run the models of the paper: Modeling Uncertainty in VaR - The Evaluation of Estimators with Heavy-tailed Distributions.

The paper was selected to be presented in the Advances in Econometrics Volume 43: Essays in Honor of M. Hashem Pesaran conference at Federal Reserve, Dallas, TX.

Potential failures of risk measures are generally associated with the uncertainty of not knowing the true data generating process (DGP) of financial series, observed either in the model specification error or parameters estimation error (Boucher et al., 2014). Neglecting these factors can lead to erroneous interpretations and imprecise risk coverage. In order to deal with the uncertainty of model specification error, this paper seeks to evaluate the performance of a set of heavy-tailed GARCH estimators to predict the risk of financial returns through the Value-at-risk (VaR). In a simulated study and employed to equity indexes returns, two versions of the ranked-based estimator are more efficient to forecast the VaR than the traditional Gaussian, Student's-t and GED procedures. Moreover, our results suggest that a higher accuracy can be achieved by performing heavy-tailed estimators. These procedures reduce the number of violations of returns from VaR predictions.
